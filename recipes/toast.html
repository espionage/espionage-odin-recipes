    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Toast is sliced bread that has been browned by radiant heat. The browning is the result of a Maillard reaction altering the flavor of the bread and making it firmer. The firm surface is easier to spread toppings on and the warmth can help butter reach its melting point.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>8 Whole Wheat Brown Bread</li>
                <li>8 teaspoons Butter (Salted)</li>    
            </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>To begin making Bread Toast Recipe, melt butter for a few seconds in microwave till the butter can be spooned easily.</li>
                <li>Heat a tawa on medium heat, once the tawa is heated, turn down the flame to low-medium and then place 2 bread slices one next to the other.</li>   
                <li>Smear a bit of butter on each bread slice using a butter knife or from the back of a flat spoon.</li> 
                <li>Place the bread slices onto the pan and allow them to brown a bit. If you are using whole wheat bread slices, browning may take a few more seconds more than the all-purpose flour bread. Keep a low heat throughout, to avoid charring. Smear with butter like you did on the other side.</li>
                <li>Flip the slices and allow to stay for about half a minute. Once the color is golden brown on both sides, take the slices off heat.</li>
                <li>Repeat the same with the rest of the bread slices.Serve immediately.</li>            
            </ol>
